*A complete Rust rewrite of [Sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock) with a modern dark web UI — single `.exe`, zero installation.*

</div>

---

## Overview

**Sherlock-RS** scans **478+ social platforms** in parallel to check whether a username exists. Just run the exe: a local server starts, your browser opens automatically, and results stream in real time.

> **New:** Simultaneous multi-username search with tabs, automatic rotation of 25 real User-Agents, and smart retry logic on network errors.

---

## Features

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| 🔍 **478+ sites scanned** | Official Sherlock database, one-click update from the UI |
| 👥 **Multi-username** | Enter multiple names at once (comma or newline), results per tab |
| ⚡ **Parallel scanning** | 20 concurrent requests via Tokio async — full scan in minutes |
| 🔄 **User-Agent rotation** | 25 real browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Opera…) rotated randomly per request |
| 🔁 **Smart retry** | 3 attempts with exponential backoff (500 ms / 1 000 ms) on network errors only |
| 🎨 **Modern UI** | Dark-themed web interface with real-time results (Server-Sent Events) |
| 🛡️ **WAF detection** | Cloudflare, PerimeterX, AWS CloudFront detected and flagged |
| 🧅 **Proxy / Tor** | Native SOCKS5 support (`socks5://127.0.0.1:9050` for Tor) |
| 📥 **Export** | Download results as CSV (spreadsheet) or TXT |
| 🔎 **Filter & sort** | Sort by name, status or response time — live text filter |
| 📦 **Zero install** | Single self-contained 5 MB `.exe`, no dependencies required |
| 🧩 **Modular Lists** | Drop JSON configs into `sites.d` to merge lists from Maigret, WhatsMyName, etc. |
| 🎯 **Dual-pattern detection** | WhatsMyName-style `e_string` / `m_string` rules — both presence AND absence must agree, sharply cutting false positives |
| 🧠 **Profile enrichment** | Per-site CSS-selector extractors pull avatar, bio, display name, location, follower count when available |
| 🔐 **Encrypted vault** | Optional SQLCipher store accumulating profile evidence across scans. Argon2id-derived key, salt-on-disk-only, 30-min idle auto-lock |
| 👤 **Human-in-the-loop** | Every cross-scan accumulation and cross-site correlation lands in a review queue. One-click "trust this batch" for high-confidence proposals when you want it |

---

## Vault — encrypted persistent store (optional)

When the `vault` feature is enabled (default), Sherlock-RS can persist hits across scans into a SQLCipher-encrypted SQLite database at `~/.local/share/sherlock-rs/vault.db` (or platform equivalent).

**First-run setup.** Click the "Set up vault" pill in the top-right of the UI, choose a passphrase, and click "Create vault". The passphrase derives the database encryption key via Argon2id; **the passphrase is never stored on disk**. Only a 16-byte salt is persisted alongside the database.

> ⚠️ **Forgetting your passphrase means permanent data loss. There is no recovery.** If you don't need persistence, skip the dialog — search works fine without a vault.

**Per-search opt-in.** In the search form, two toggles control vault behavior:
- *Save to vault* — persist hits and extracted profile fields to the vault. Silently ignored when the vault is locked.
- *Auto-accept* (enabled only when "Save to vault" is on) — apply high-confidence (≥80%) merge proposals immediately; lower-confidence ones still queue for review.

**Review queue.** A purple "N pending" pill appears in the top-right whenever there are merges waiting for human judgement. Click it to accept/reject each proposal individually or accept all at once. Every action is recorded in the encrypted audit log.

**Idle auto-lock.** The vault auto-locks after 30 minutes of inactivity. Re-enter your passphrase to unlock.

**Build without the vault stack.** SQLCipher adds ~45–90s to a clean build. For CI environments or contributors not touching encryption:

```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features
```

The resulting binary is functionally identical to today's Sherlock-RS — all vault routes are absent, no SQLCipher dependency is pulled in.

## Installation

### Quick method — Download the binary

1. Download the latest release from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/Oli97430/sherlock-rs/releases) page
2. Double-click `sherlock-rs.exe`
3. Your browser opens automatically — that's it

### Build from source

**Requirements:**
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (install via `rustup`)
- [Visual Studio Build Tools 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with the *Desktop development with C++* workload

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Oli97430/sherlock-rs.git
cd sherlock-rs
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be located at `target/release/sherlock-rs.exe`.

---

## Usage

```bash
sherlock-rs.exe
```

The program starts a local server on a random port and opens your default browser. No extra commands needed.

### Basic steps

1. Enter one or more usernames to search (separated by comma or newline)
2. Adjust options if needed (timeout, proxy, NSFW)
3. Click **Hunt** or press `Enter`
4. Results appear in real time, site by site
5. Export results as CSV or TXT via the dedicated buttons

### Multi-username search

The input field accepts multiple names at once:

```
johndoe
janedoe, alice
```

Each username gets its own tab with a live counter of accounts found. The tab being scanned pulses in blue.

### Interface options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| **Timeout** | Maximum wait time per request (default: 30 s, min: 5 s) |
| **NSFW** | Include adult content platforms in the search |
| **Proxy** | SOCKS5 or HTTP proxy URL, e.g. `socks5://127.0.0.1:9050` for Tor |
| **Update DB** | Downloads the latest site database from GitHub |

### Custom Sites & Modularisation

Sherlock-RS supports modular site lists. While it automatically fetches the upstream Sherlock `data.json` database, you can dynamically expand its coverage by dropping your own `.json` files into the local `sites.d` configuration directory.

The location of this directory depends on your OS:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\sherlock-rs\sites.d` (or `Local\sherlock-rs\sites.d`)
- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.local/share/sherlock-rs/sites.d`

Whenever Sherlock-RS starts or you click **Update DB**, it will load the primary database and merge it with any `.json` files found in the `sites.d` folder.

#### Adapting OSINT/SOCMINT Lists
You can easily incorporate databases from other top-tier OSINT tools by converting them to the [Sherlock JSON schema](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/blob/master/sherlock_project/resources/data.json).

Exhaustive list of contemporary tools whose site lists can be adapted:
1. **WhatsMyName (WebOsis)**: The largest and most actively maintained OSINT username database (over 600+ sites). Converts perfectly via mapping `uri_check` to `url` and matching their `string_match` to Sherlock's `errorMsg` or `status_code` logic.
2. **Maigret**: A powerful fork of Sherlock with enhanced extraction. Their sites list natively supports the Sherlock JSON schema with extra metadata. Just copy their JSON into `sites.d/maigret.json`.
3. **Blackbird**: An ultra-fast scanner. Its site lists can be parsed into Sherlock's format, primarily relying on HTTP status code checks.
4. **Nexfil**: A fast OSINT tool written in Python. Its JSON mappings (`url`, `errorType`) can be mapped directly to Sherlock's format.
5. **Holehe**: Primarily used for email OSINT, but tracks unique site endpoints. Endpoints can be mapped if user-facing profile URLs are available.

*Note: Ensure your custom JSON files do not have overlapping site keys with the main database unless you intend to overwrite the default behavior.*

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Enter` | Start search (from the username field) |
| `Shift + Enter` | Add a new line (multi-username input) |
| `Escape` | Stop the current search |

---

## How it works

### Detection methods

Sherlock-RS faithfully implements the 3 detection methods from the original project:

| Type | Logic |
|---|---|
| `status_code` | HTTP 404 (or custom code) → not found; 200-299 → found |
| `message` | Specific error text found in response body → not found |
| `response_url` | Redirects disabled; 200-299 → found, otherwise not found |

WAF detection (Cloudflare, PerimeterX…) is applied **first**, before any other logic, to avoid false positives. Blocked results are reported separately with the **Blocked** status.

### User-Agent rotation

Each individual request randomly picks a User-Agent from 25 real modern browsers:

- Chrome 128–131 (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android)
- Firefox 130–133 (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Edge 130–131 (Windows, macOS)
- Safari 17 (macOS, iOS)
- Opera 116, Brave

This significantly reduces bot-detection-based blocking.

### Exponential backoff retry

On network errors (timeout, connection refused, DNS failure):

```
Attempt 1  →  fails  →  wait 500 ms
Attempt 2  →  fails  →  wait 1 000 ms
Attempt 3  →  final result (success or error displayed)
```

Valid HTTP responses (even 403 or 404) do **not** trigger a retry.

---

## Result statuses

| Status | Meaning | Tip |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ **Found** | Account detected on the platform | Click the URL to open the profile |
| ❌ **Not found** | No account under this name | — |
| ⚠️ **Blocked** | Blocked by a WAF (Cloudflare…) | Retry with a proxy or Tor |
| 🔴 **Error** | Network error or timeout after 3 attempts | Increase the timeout |
| ⬜ **Invalid** | Username format doesn't match the site's rules | Normal for some sites |
